I litterally made this because I was bored and it was easy. Well... I like having fun so. Enjoy.

This mod makes it so that when Creepers explode (taken from original post):
*No crater is left.
*Deals more damage to entities.
*Grass and farmland become dirt.
*Leaves are destroyed and sometimes catch on fire.
*Stone will drop falling cobblestone until there is a block under it. (mineshaft caving in)
